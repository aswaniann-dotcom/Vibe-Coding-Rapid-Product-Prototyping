# Website AI Chatbot — Context-Aware Web Content Assistant (Prototype)

This project showcases a **Website AI Chatbot prototype** built using **AI-assisted / vibe-coding tools such as Google AI Studio**. The chatbot helps users quickly understand the content of any website by summarizing key information and answering questions **strictly grounded in the website’s content**.

The prototype focuses on **UX exploration, conversational AI behavior, and system prompt design**, rather than production deployment.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Users visiting a website often struggle to:
- Quickly understand what the site is about
- Identify key information without reading long pages
- Know what questions to ask to explore the site further

Traditional chatbots either hallucinate answers or lack contextual grounding.

## 💡 Solution Overview

This prototype implements a **context-aware AI chatbot** that:
- Reads and analyzes a user-provided website URL
- Summarizes the website’s key points
- Suggests relevant questions a curious visitor might ask
- Answers follow-up questions using **only the website’s content**
- Maintains conversational context across interactions

---

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

### 🌐 Website Content Understanding
- Extracts readable text from the provided URL
- Identifies key themes and information
- Produces a concise summary for first-time visitors

---

### ❓ Smart Question Suggestions
- Generates **4–6 diverse, relevant questions** after initial analysis
- Helps users explore the website intuitively
- Adapts suggestions based on conversation flow

---

### 💬 Context-Aware Q&A
- Answers user questions using only the extracted website content
- Keeps responses:
  - Short
  - Factual
  - Conversational
- Avoids hallucinations and unsupported claims

---

### 🔁 Conversational Continuity
- Remembers previous questions about the same website
- Suggests **2–3 intelligent follow-up questions** after each response
- Encourages natural exploration of the site

---

### ⚠️ Graceful Handling of Missing Information
- If content is unclear or unavailable, the chatbot:
  - Politely informs the user
  - Avoids speculative answers

---

## 🧾 Response Format

All chatbot responses follow a consistent structure:
Answer: <short, clear reply>

You could also ask:

<follow-up question 1>
<follow-up question 2>
<follow-up question 3>


This ensures clarity, predictability, and a smooth user experience.
